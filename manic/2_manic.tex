\section{MANIC Architecture}
\label{manic:manic}
\manic is a processor microarchitecture that implements the
vector-dataflow execution model to improve energy efficiency while
maintaining programmability and generality.
%
\manic's hardware/software interface is the most recent revision of the RISC-V
ISA vector extension~\cite{riscv_2019}.
%
\manic adds a vector unit with a single lane to a simple, in-order scalar processor core.
%
The vector unit has a few simple additions to support vector-dataflow execution: instruction windowing hardware and a renaming mechanism together implement
forwarding between dependent instructions.
%
With no modifications to the ISA, \manic runs programs efficiently.  With a
minor ISA change, \manic further improves efficiency by conveying register kill
annotations; the microarchitecture uses these annotations to
kill registers instead of incurring the cost of writing them to the vector
register file. 

\subsection{Vector ISA}
\label{manic:manic:isa}
The software interface to \manic's vector execution engine is the RISC-V ISA
vector extension~\cite{riscv_2019} and RISC-V code\footnote{Specifically, RISC-V E extension, which uses 16 architectural registers.} will run efficiently on a \manic
system with only minor modifications to add {\tt vfence} instructions for synchronization and  memory consistency. 

A programmer may further optionally recompile their code using our custom \manic
compiler to use minor ISA changes that support code scheduling and vector
register kill annotations.  We emphasize that these compiler-based features do
not require programming changes, do not expose microarchitectural details, and
are optional to the effective use of \manic.%

\manic implements the RISC-V V vector extension. RISC-V V does not specify a
fixed number of vector registers, but its register name encoding includes five
bits for vector register names.  We implement 16 vector registers, requiring
four bits to name, and leaving a single bit in the register name unused.
We use the extra bit in a register's name to convey kill annotations from the
compiler to the microarchitecture.  If either of an instruction's input
registers has its high-order bit set, the encoded instruction indicates to
\manic that the register dies at the instruction.
%
To support code scheduling, \manic's optional compiler support runs the
dataflow code scheduling algorithm (described in \autoref{manic:design:schedule}).
%
After scheduling, the compiler analyzes definitions and uses of each register
and adds a kill annotation to a killed register's name in the instruction 
at which it dies. 

\subsection{Microarchitecture}
\label{manic:manic:uarch}
The foundation of \manic's microarchitecture is an extremely simple, in-order,
single-issue vector core with a single execution lane that is equipped with a
single functional unit. 
%
\manic adds four components to this base vector core to support vector-dataflow execution: (1) issue logic and a register renaming table; (2) an
instruction window buffer; (3) an xdata buffer and (4) a forwarding buffer. 
% 
\autoref{fig:manic:block} shows an overview of \manic's design and how these
components relate to one another.
%

\figMANICBlock

\paragraph{Issue logic and register renaming}
\manic's issue logic is primarily responsible for creating a window of
instructions to execute according to vector-dataflow.
%
The issue logic activates once per window of instructions, identifying,
preparing, and issuing for execution a window of dependent instructions over an entire vector of inputs.
%
A key parameter of the issue logic is the length of the instruction buffer
window, which we explain next.
%
The issue logic analyzes a short sequence of instructions that has the same
number of instructions as the instruction buffer can hold. 
%
The issue logic identifies dataflow between instructions by comparing the names
of their input and output operands. 
%
If two instructions are dependent --- the output of one of the instructions is 
the input of another ---  \manic should forward the output value directly from
its producer to the input of the consumer, avoiding the register file.
\manic's issue logic implements forwarding by renaming the instructions' register operands 
to refer to a free location in \manic's forwarding
buffer, instead of to the register file. 
%
The issue logic records the renaming in \manic's renaming table, which is a
fixed-size, directly-indexed table, with one entry for each register that can
be renamed in a window of instructions.
%
After the issue logic identifies dependent operations and performs renaming for
a window of operations, it dispatches the window of operations for execution.


\paragraph{Instruction window}
\manic uses its instruction window to store an issued window of
instructions that have had their register operands renamed by the issue logic.
%
The instruction window and its associated control logic (not pictured)
determine what operation \manic's single functional unit should execute next.
%
The instruction window's control logic executes the operation represented by each instruction stored in the 
buffer. 
%
As \autoref{manic:design} describes, execution proceeds first vertically,
through the entire window, and then horizontally through the vector.
%
A key feature of the instruction window's control logic is its ability to
select an operand's source or destination. 
%
For input operands, the instruction window controls whether to fetch an operand from the
vector register file or from \manic's forwarding buffer (in the case of an
operand being forwarded between instructions in the window).
%
Likewise, for output operands, the instruction window controls whether to write
an output operand to the vector register file, to the forwarding buffer, or to both.

\paragraph{Limits to window size}
There are several classes of instructions that limit window size.
%
These include stores, permutations, and reductions.
%
Permutations and reductions require interactions between elements in a vector, which
creates a {\em horizontal} dependence between operations on different vector elements.
%
\manic does not support forwarding for such operations because of the complexity of
the dependence tracking that they introduce.  
% 
Instead, these operations execute one element at a time, ultimately writing to the vector register file. 

A store also ends issuing for a window.  A store may write to a memory
location that a later operation loads from. Such a through-memory dependence is 
unknown until execution time.  Consequently, \manic conservatively assumes
that the address of any store may alias with the address of any load or store in the window (i.e., in a later vector element).
A store ends the construction of a window to avoid the need for dynamic memory disambiguation to
detect and avoid the effect of such aliasing.
% 
We evaluated adding a \emph{non-aliasing store} instruction that would allow \manic to forward past stores,
but this instruction improved energy-efficiency by less than $0.5\%$ in our applications.
% 
This is because store instructions often naturally close windows (e.g. a {\tt vfence} follows the store to ensure correctness).
% 
Thus, given the added programming complexity for minimum benefit, we conclude that such an instruction is unnecessary.
%

\paragraph{Xdata buffer}
Some instructions like vector loads and stores require extra information 
(e.g. base address and stride) available from the scalar register file when the instruction is decoded.
%
Due to the loosely coupled nature of \manic, this extra information must be buffered 
alongside the vector instruction.
%
Since not all vector instructions require values from the scalar register file, 
\manic includes a separate buffer, called the xdata buffer, to hold this extra
information.
%
Entries in the instruction buffer contain indices into the xdata buffer as needed.
%
During execution, \manic uses these indices to read information from the xdata buffer and execute accordingly.

\paragraph{Forwarding buffer} The forwarding buffer is a small, directly-indexed
buffer that stores intermediate values as \manic's execution unit forwards them to
dependent instructions in the instruction window. 
%
The issue logic lazily allocates space in the forwarding buffer and renames instruction's forwarded operands to refer to these allocated entries.
%
The benefit of the forwarding buffer is that it is very small and simple, which
corresponds to a very low static power and access energy compared to the very 
high static power and access energy of the vector register file.
%
By accessing the forwarding buffer instead of accessing the vector register
file, an instruction with one or more forwarded operands consumes less energy
than one that executes without \manic. 

\paragraph{Efficient reductions}
RISC-V V contains {reduction} instructions like \texttt{vredsum v1 v2},
which adds up all elements of \texttt{v2} and writes the sum into the first element of \texttt{v1}.
%
\manic relies on the forwarding buffer to avoid VRF accesses for reductions.
% 
Instead of writing partial results to the VRF,
\manic allocates space in the forwarding buffer for partial accumulation.
% 
The decode logic recognizes a reduction, allocates space, and remaps the second source operand and the destination to point to the entry in the forwarding buffer.
% 
During execution, \manic will then use the partial result in the forwarding buffer as one source for the reduction (e.g., sum)
and overwrite it with the new value as it is produced.
% 
This optimization re-purposes \manic's existing dataflow mechanisms
to save an entire vector-length of VRF reads and writes for reductions.

\paragraph{Structural hazards}
There are three structural hazards that cause \manic to stop buffering additional
instructions, stall the scalar core, and start vector execution. 
%
The first hazard occurs when the instruction buffer is full and another vector instruction is waiting to be buffered.
%
The second hazard occurs when all slots in the forwarding buffer are allocated and an incoming instruction requires a slot.
%
Finally, the third hazard occurs when the xdata buffer is full and a decoded 
vector instruction requires a slot.
%
The prevalence of each hazard depends on the size of the buffers associated with each.
%
The first hazard is most common, while the other two tend to be rare.

\subsection{Memory system}
\label{manic:manic:memory}
\manic includes an instruction cache (icache) and a data cache (dcache).
%
This departs from the designs of many commercial microcontrollers 
in the ultra-low-power computing domain, which do
not have dcaches and have extremely small icaches on the order of 
64 bytes~\cite{msp430fr5994}.
%
However, we find that even small or moderately sized dcaches (512B) are effective in minimizing the number of accesses to main memory. 
%
We measured miss curves for the seven different application we consider; 
for each application there is an extreme drop-off in the number of misses for even 
small cache sizes,  and with a 512B cache the curves are basically flat.
%
Since the energy of an access to main memory dwarfs an access to the dcache,
the dcache offers a significant reduction in energy.

\paragraph{Caching and intermittence}
In the intermittent computing domain, improperly managed caches may
lead to memory corruption because dirty data may be lost when power fails.
%
As such, \manic assumes a hardware-software JIT-checkpointing mechanism
(like~\cite{hibernusplusplus, samoyed, quickrecall}) for protecting the caches
and any dirty data.
%
Checkpointing energy for cached data is virtually negligible because caches are
very small relative to the operating period. 
%

\subsection{Putting it together with an example}
We illustrate the operation of the issue logic, renaming table, instruction
window, and forwarding buffer with an example of \manic's operation, shown in
\autoref{fig:manic:vde:issue}. 
%
The figure starts with vector-aware assembly code that \manic transforms into
vector-dataflow operations by populating the renaming table and instruction
buffer with information about the dataflow.
%
Vector assembly instructions pass into \manic's microarchitectural mechanisms
as they decode to the issue logic and later execute.
%

\figMANICMANICa

\paragraph{Issuing instructions and renaming operands}
The figure shows a three-instruction program and illustrates how
the issue logic populates the instruction buffer and remaps registers for each
instruction.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt vload}:
The issue logic records the load in the instruction window and, since the instruction
is a vector load and requires a base address, also inserts the base address ({\tt \&a} forwarded from the scalar register file) into the xdata buffer.
% 
In addition, the issue logic writes an empty renaming entry to {\tt v0} in the renaming table along with the index of the instruction in the instruction buffer.
%
An empty renaming entry at execution time signifies a vector register write.
However, during issue, an empty entry may be filled by an instruction added to
the instruction window later during the same issue phase.
\item {\tt vmul}: The multiply instruction consumes two register operands that are not in the renaming table and, at execution time, will issue
two vector register file reads.
%
As with the load, the issue logic records the multiply's output register with 
an empty entry in the renaming table as well as the index of the multiply in the
instruction buffer.
\item {\tt vadd}:
The add's inputs are {\tt v0} and {\tt v1} with the kill annotation indicating
that the instruction kills register {\tt v0}.
%
The issue logic looks up each input operand in the renaming table and, finding 
both have valid entries, identifies this instruction as the target for forwarding.
%
The issue logic remaps {\tt v0} to refer to the first entry of the forwarding
buffer and {\tt v1} to the second position. 
%
The load instruction in the instruction buffer (found by the saved index in the renaming table) 
is updated and will store its result in {\tt F0} instead of {\tt v0}.
%
Similarly, the multiply instruction is also updated and will store its result in {\tt F1}, but since {\tt v1} is not killed, it will still be written-back to the register file. 
%
The add instruction then will fetch its input operands from {\tt F0}
and {\tt F1} instead of the vector register file.
%
The kill annotations associated with {\tt v3} and {\tt v0} follow the re-written
instructions into the instruction window, enabling their use during execution
to avoid register file writes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Executing a window of instructions}
After issue, the window of instructions is ready to execute.
\autoref{fig:manic:vde:execute} shows (via the orange control-flow arcs) how \manic
executes the entire window vertically for a single vector element before moving
on to execute the entire window for the second vector element.
%
The blue dataflow arcs show how \manic forwards values between dependent
instructions using its forwarding buffer.  The green squares marked with ``F'' names
are forwarded values.
%
The figure also shows how \manic uses a kill annotation at runtime.
%
The registers with kill annotations ({\tt v0} and {\tt v3}) need not be written
to the vector register file when the window completes executing, sparing the
execution two vector register writes required by a typical vector execution.

\subsection{Microarchitecture-agnostic dataflow scheduling}
\label{manic:design:schedule}
\manic's final feature is {\em microarchitecture-agnostic
dataflow scheduling}.
%
This feature is optional compiler support that
re-orders vector instructions to make dependent operations as close as possible to one another.  If dependent operations are closer together in an instruction
sequence, then it is more likely that they will appear together in one of
\manic's vector-dataflow windows.  By re-ordering operations to appear close
together in a window, \manic creates more opportunities to
forward values from a producer instruction to its consumer,
eliminating more vector register file accesses.

\manic's dataflow scheduler does not compromise programmability or generality.
The programmer need not understand the microarchitecture to reap the benefits
of the dataflow scheduler.  The dataflow scheduler minimizes the forwarding
distance between dependent instructions, rather than targeting a particular
window size.  While not always optimal for a given window size, this
microarchitec-ture-agnostic optimization prevents the compiler from being
brittle or dependent on the microarchitectural parameters of a
particular system. 

To minimize forwarding distance between dependent instructions, \manic's
dataflow code scheduler uses {\em sum kill distance}.  A vector register's
kill distance is the number of instructions between when an instruction defines
the register and when the value in the register is used for the last time
(i.e., the register dies).  The sum kill distance is the sum of all registers'
kill distances across the entire program. To remain agnostic to the window size
of particular \manic implementation, the code
scheduler minimizes the sum kill distance (which is equivalent to minimizing
average kill distance).  Sum kill distance is a proxy for the number of
register writes in a program because if a register does not die during a
window's execution, the system must write its value back to the register file.
%
When sequences of dependent instructions are closer together, their
intermediate values die more quickly, because registers need not remain live
waiting for unrelated instructions to execute.  A larger window accommodates
dependence chains that include longer kill distances.

We implement dataflow code scheduling using brute force (exhaustive) search
for small kernels containing fewer than 12 vector operations.  For larger
kernels (e.g., FFT), we implement dataflow code scheduling via simulated
annealing that randomly mutates instruction schedules, 
while preserving dependences, to produce a new valid schedule, accepting 
this new schedule with some probability.

\figMANICKill

\autoref{fig:manic:kill} shows that the microarchitecture-agnostic minimization of
the sum kill distance closely approximates a microarchitecture-specific
approach that optimizes for a particular window size.
%
The plot shows the number of register writes made by one iteration of the
kernel's inner loop for a given window size using code optimized by the two
different optimization criteria. 
%
The blue line shows the number of register writes of a \emph{microarchitecture-specific} schedule,
where window size is exposed to the compiler.  The red line shows the number of writes
for our \emph{microarchitecture-agnostic} schedule based on sum kill distance.
%
The two curves generally agree, suggesting that minimizing sum kill distance eliminates
register writes with similar efficacy as when window size is exposed explicitly to the compiler.
%
For the FFT kernel, the instruction window is broken by stores and permutations (\autoref{manic:manic:uarch}),
causing additional vector register file writes.
This is a limitation of optimizing only for sum kill distance
that we plan to address in future work.
