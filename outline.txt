0. Abstract
1. Introduction
	a. Low-powered sensor devices are becoming popular
	b. Many new applications, requiring sophisticated computation
	c. Cloud offloading is not feasible
		i. Range, limited bandwidth, privacy but mainly energy
	d. Devices are severely resource and energy constrained
		i. Battery-powered devices
		ii. Energy-harvesting devices
			- Challenges w/ intermittent execution
	e. Existing devices are energy-inefficient
		i. Stupid reasons
		ii. Pay a huge cost for programmability
	f. Specialization gains energy-efficiency at the expense of programmability
		i. Premature
		ii. NRE costs
	g. ASICs & existing devices assume there is a trade-off
		i. Flawed argument because of execution models
	h. Needs to provide right interface for maintain programmability
		i. Requiring applications to be rewritten is not scalable
		ii. Need to be able to apply to existing embedded software
	i. Objective of this work
		i. Thesis
		ii. SONIC
		iii. MANIC
		iv. SNAFU
		v. Riptide
