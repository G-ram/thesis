abstract = {We developed Chlorophyll, a synthesis-aided programming model and compiler for the GreenArrays GA144, an extremely minimalist low-power spatial architecture that requires partitioning the program into fragments of no more than 256 instructions and 64 words of data. This processor is 100-times more energy efficient than its competitors, but currently can only be programmed using a low-level stack-based language.The Chlorophyll programming model allows programmers to provide human insight by specifying partial partitioning of data and computation. The Chlorophyll compiler relies on synthesis, sidestepping the need to develop classical optimizations, which may be challenging given the unusual architecture. To scale synthesis to real problems, we decompose the compilation into smaller synthesis subproblems---partitioning, layout, and code generation. We show that the synthesized programs are no more than 65% slower than highly optimized expert-written programs and are faster than programs produced by a heuristic, non-synthesizing version of our compiler.},

However, the proposed mechanisms are complex and introduce new mapping complications. This paper presents a greatly simplified approach to dataflow execution, called the explicit token store (ETS) architecture, and its current realization in Monsoon. The essence of dynamic dataflow execution is captured by a simple transition on state bits associated with storage local to a processor. Low-level storage management is performed by the compiler in assigning nodes to slots in an activation frame, rather than dynamically in hardware. The processor is simple, highly pipelined, and quite general. It may be viewed as a generalization of a fairly primitive von Neumann architecture. Although the addressing capability is restrictive, there is exactly one instruction executed for each action on the dataflow graph. Thus, the machine oriented ETS model provides new understanding of the merits and the real cost of direct execution of dataflow graphs.},

abstract = {This position paper examines a spectrum of approaches to overcoming the limited computing power of mobile devices caused by their need to be small, lightweight and energy efficient. At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a software-hardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.},

abstract = {Cloud services are becoming increasingly globalized and data-center workloads are expanding exponentially. GPU and FPGA-based clouds have illustrated improvements in power and performance by accelerating compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a promising way to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a given datacenter computation (e.g. YouTube transcoding) by reducing both energy consumption and marginal computation cost.The feasibility of an ASIC Cloud for a particular application is directly gated by the ability to manage the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs of designing and fabricating the ASIC, so that it is significantly lower (e.g. 2X) than the TCO of the best available alternative.In this paper, we show that technology node selection is a major tool for managing ASIC Cloud NRE, and allows the designer to trade off an accelerator's excess energy efficiency and cost performance for lower total cost.We explore NRE and cross-technology optimization of ASIC Clouds for four different applications: Bitcoin mining, YouTube-style video transcoding, Litecoin, and Deep Learning. We address these challenges and show large reductions in the NRE, potentially enabling ASIC Clouds to address a wider variety of datacenter workloads. Our results suggest that advanced nodes like 16nm will lead to sub-optimal TCO for many workloads, and that use of older nodes like 65nm can enable a greater diversity of ASIC Clouds.},
